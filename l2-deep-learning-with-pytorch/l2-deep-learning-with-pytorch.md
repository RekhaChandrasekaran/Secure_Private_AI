 ## Lesson 2 - Deep Learning with PyTorch

 * **Tensors** - basic data structure in PyTorch
 * **Autograd** - calculates gradients for backpropagation
 * **TorchVision** - Computer Vision package
 * **GPU** - accelerates network computations - linear algebra operations
 * **Validation** - how well does my model generalize?
 * PyTorch works well with Python/Numpy/Scipy stack

 ### Part 1 - Single Layer Neural Networks
 * **Hyperparameters** - parameters of the network that are different from weights and biases.  
 * We can easily convert between `tensors` and `ndarrays`. They share memory, changing one affects the other.
 * `torch.mm()` - matrix multiplication - involves multiply and sum.
